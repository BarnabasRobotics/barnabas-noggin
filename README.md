Production Version
Created by Eric Lin
Using KiCAD

This is the prototype KiCad .pro file for the RevD version of the Barnabas Noggin. This version of the board, as of 4/5/17, is completely untested, and is likely to remain that way. This version is intended to act as a control file that will remain static as other versions are added and changed.
